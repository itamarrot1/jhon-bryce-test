##  I made a project that performs various operations on a CSV file that includes details on daimonds


# class Actions(Enum):
    HIGHEST_PRICE = 1  --- check what the most expensive daimond from the list
    AVARAGE = 2 --- check what the avarage price of all the daimond in the list
    IDEL_NUMBER = 3 --- check how many in ideal confition
    CHECEK_COLOR_KIND = 4 --- check how many color there is for the daimond


when i upload the csv to the py i convert every daimond to an object in a class clled daimond"# jhon-bryce-test"
